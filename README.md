# final-project

this project is intended as an easy way to keep track of a christmas list with all the different sites alongside prices.

the home page options menu has an add item option, and once in an item description the menu becomes a delete item menu button instead.

i cant get the adapter to update the array list i used for displaying everything in a list view, so you have to reload the app to see any changes you made aside from editing pre displayed items.
